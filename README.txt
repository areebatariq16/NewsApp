1. Refactoring Techniques
Newsapp.js, Card.js, FormComponent.js, App.js:

Functional Components: Converted class components to functional components using React hooks for state and lifecycle management.

Code Simplification: Simplified functions and handlers, breaking down complex components into smaller, reusable components.

Consistent Styling: Applied consistent and readable naming conventions, and ensured code formatting is neat and organized.

Memoization: Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders for the Card component.

2. Validation Techniques
FormComponent.js:

Formik: Used Formik for form state management and submission handling.

Yup Validation Schema: Utilized Yup to define and enforce validation rules for form inputs, ensuring user inputs are valid (e.g., valid email address).

3. Performance Monitoring Techniques
App.js, Newsapp.js:

React Profiler: Wrapped components with the React Profiler to measure render times and identify performance bottlenecks.

Profiling Callbacks: Analyzed render phases, durations, and interaction data to understand performance metrics and optimize rendering.

File Breakdown
Newsapp.js:

Manages state and lifecycle for fetching and displaying news articles.

Uses Context API to manage global state (e.g., search term, news data, form visibility).

NewsContext.js:

Provides global state management using the Context API.

Centralizes state logic and API call for fetching news data.

Card.js:

Displays individual news articles.

Optimized with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

FormComponent.js:

Manages the newsletter subscription form.

Uses Formik for form state and Yup for validation.

Handles form submission and closes the modal upon success.

App.js:

Wraps the main application component with the React Profiler for performance monitoring.

Renders the Newsapp component within the Profiler.

These techniques and tools collectively improve code maintainability, ensure valid user inputs, and enhance performance monitoring.
